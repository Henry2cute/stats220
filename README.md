# The different types of coffee beans
## Introduction
#### **When we brew coffee, the quality of the coffee beans directly determines the taste of the coffee. For some new coffee drinkers then, it is important to know the different varieties of [coffee beans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean). Today I will introduce the top nine coffee bean varieties in the world.**
## The world's top three original coffee bean varieties
1. Arabica
:*The most iconic variety, more than 75% of our current coffee beans comes from its various variants and derivatives. Arabica has a good aroma, and an elegant flavour and is a delight to drink.*

2. Robusta
:*The Robusta originated in the Congo region of West Africa, and it is, strictly speaking, the Kanefra species to which it belongs that is in the same stratum as the Arabica. Robusta is resistant to diseases but is relatively homogeneous in terms of flavour.*

3. Liberica
:*A bean variety that has "disappeared" because it is less aromatic than Arabica and less bitter than Robusta, and is gradually being phased out.*

### The Arabica family

Arabica has developed most rapidly and expansively. After natural mutations, natural crosses and man-made hybrids, Arabica varieties of beans have blossomed all over the world and occupy half of the coffee world.

- Typica
: One of the oldest native bean varieties, belonging to Arabica. Its presence was crucial to developing later varieties of coffee beans, from which the Blue Mountain, Mantenin, Elephant, Kona, Yunnan small round beans and many others were derived, all of which are well known.
- Geisha
: A mutant derivative of the Tippecka, Geisha became famous at the end of the 20th century when it won the BOP award at the Emerald Estate in Panama. It has since become a representative of the best coffee beans. It is noted for its richness of flavour and delicacy of touch.
- Bourbon
: Bourbon is also one of the ancient native species and belongs to the Arabica family. The Bourbon fruit is conical, and the bean has a superior fruity flavour and sharp acidity.
- Caturra
: A variant of Bourbon was discovered in Brazil in the 1950s. Disease resistance and production are superior to Bourbon, and the flavour is no less distinctive, with a unique lime zest to the market. One of the green-topped dwarf varieties, with fruit bunches and higher yields, is quite popular.
- SL28
: A hybrid variety of Bourbon, cultivated by the Scott Laboratory in Kenya, with higher yields, lower disease resistance, and an intense berry flavour, currently grown mainly in Kenya and El Salvador (less frequently).
- Mundo Novo
: A cross between Bourbon and Mantenin, also known as "Mundo Novo". It is adaptable to its environment, with high yields, pest and disease resistance, good cup quality and excellent flavour and balance.
- Pacamara
ï¼š Pacamara also belongs to Arabica. Pacamara is a cross between Pacas and Elephant beans (Malagozhpi), a variant of Bourbon that inherits the excellent flavour genes of Bourbon.
